I am Justin Ho, a Computer Science student attending Vanderbilt University's School of Engineering.

ðŸŒ± Currently, I am studying to become a back-end software engineer and am mainly interested in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and automation, however, I love all things that have to do with programming. The repositories hosted on my GitHub profile showcase my progress since I first started programming and my drive to become a better coder than I was the day before.

ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on building my programming skills and knowledge through personal projects, fun challenges, hackathons, etc., and hope to learn as much as possible before venturing off into the world after university.

ðŸ‘¯ If you have any interest in working with me on any program ideas, startups, or fun projects please feel free to reach out. Similarly, any job, co-op, or internship opportunities are always welcome.

ðŸ“« You can reach me at my email: hojustin2005@outlook.com

Welcome to my GitHub!!!
